# FoodRecipeApp
### *Reason for making this app:*
I made this app for my friend, who wanted an app that would select 5 random dishes and recipes and present for his mother's use. 

## If you want to add more dishes & recipes:
1. Open to www/js/main.js
2. Add another dish to the food[]
3. Do so by adding a {"foodName":"insert food name", "url":"insert recipe url"}

## How to use:
Depending on the platform you are using it will vary. 

If you are using a version of iOS on your phone you will have to do the following:
1. Open the www/platofrms/ios, and then open the .workspace file in xcode
2. Then run the code on your phone

If you are using a version of android on your phone you will have to do the following:
1. Open the gradle.build file in android studio
2. Launch the application from android studio, and select your phone as the destination

## To do: 
1. Add the ios platform
2. Build the ios platform
3. Change the different images in the res folder for the Android & ios icon
4. Change the different images in the res folder for the Android & ios screen
